## Organize codebase
we will try a **MVC** model
- **Controller** (Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view)
- **Model** (The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
  View)
- **View** (In the future will be an android app)
- **Utils** (Our custom tools to help us)
